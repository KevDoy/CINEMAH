With simple to edit code...
`<a href="URL TO MOVIE"><img class="cover" src="./covers/COVER IMAGE" /></a>`
The rest takes care of itself

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Due to the simple nature of this project, you can run this locally on your machine, host it on a web server or anything else you'd like.
I do suggest that you use the .htpasswd and .htaccess in the /start/ folder to block access to any outsiders.
